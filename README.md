<h3 align="center">💻 Web Developer in the making | ⚙️ Logic lover | 🌐 Curious about how the web really works</h3>

I’m someone who likes to understand things from the basics.
Instead of just making things “work”, I try to figure out *why* they work.
Most of my learning comes from breaking stuff, fixing it, and building it again — better.

🧠 About Me  

🎓 Computer Science student, focused on strengthening fundamentals  
🛠️ Learning by doing — small projects, experiments, and practice  
🧩 I enjoy writing simple, readable code more than flashy solutions  
🌱 Currently improving my skills in JavaScript, backend logic, and problem-solving  
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy projects that look difficult but turn out to be logical
