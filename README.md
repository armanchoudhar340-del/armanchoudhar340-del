Hi 👋, I'm Arman Choudhary  

💻 Web Developer in the making | ⚙️ Logic lover | 🌐 Curious about how the web really works  

I’m someone who likes to understand things from the basics.
Instead of just making things “work”, I try to figure out *why* they work.
Most of my learning comes from breaking stuff, fixing it, and building it again — better.

🧠 About Me  

🎓 Computer Science student, focused on strengthening fundamentals  
🛠️ Learning by doing — small projects, experiments, and practice  
🧩 I enjoy writing simple, readable code more than flashy solutions  
🌱 Currently improving my skills in JavaScript, backend logic, and problem-solving  
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy projects that look difficult but turn out to be logical  

🧰 What I Work With  

💻 Web Basics  
HTML • CSS • JavaScript  

⚙️ Programming & Logic  
C++ • Data Structures (beginner–intermediate level)  

🛠️ Tools I Use  
Git • GitHub • VS Code  

📌 What I Like Building  

- Small frontend projects to practice layouts & logic  
- JavaScript-based mini apps  
- College assignments turned into clean projects  
- Practice programs for C++ and problem-solving  

📈 Goals  

📚 Get strong at fundamentals  
🧪 Practice consistently, even with small ideas  
🚀 Build projects that actually show learning progress
